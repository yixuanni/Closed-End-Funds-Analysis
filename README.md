# Closed-End-Funds-Analysis

Week 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Clean the dataset by addressing any data quality issues and standardizing variable formats.

Week 2: Quantitative Analysis Apply statistical methods to analyze the historical performance of closed-end funds. Utilize regression analysis to identify factors influencing fund returns. 

Week 3: Risk-Return Optimization Implement optimization models to find an optimal allocation of funds that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. Consider historical data on returns and risk measures to inform the optimization process. 

Week 4: Factor Analysis and Machine Learning Explore factor models to identify underlying factors affecting fund performance. Consider the application of machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, classification, or clustering to identify patterns and trends in the dataset. 

Additional Goal: Design a program that automates the monthly adjustment of your investment portfolio based on the developed FoF strategy. Ensure the program incorporates the identified optimal allocation and any other relevant factors from the research.
